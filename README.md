# Claymorphism and Glassmorphism Design with Blended Image Background

This project showcases a unique blend of Claymorphism and Glassmorphism effects using HTML and CSS. The design combines the soft, 3D-like appearance of Claymorphism with the frosted glass effect of Glassmorphism, creating a modern, stylish UI. An image is blended into the background, providing depth, while text content overlays the glass effect, making the entire design visually engaging.

## Features

- **Claymorphism Background**: The background features a smooth, 3D clay-like effect that gives the UI a soft, tactile appearance.
- **Glassmorphism Overlay**: The frosted glass effect overlays the claymorphic background, allowing for a seamless blend between the background image and the text content.
- **Blended Image**: An image is integrated into the design, blending into the claymorphic background and enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Text Content Overlay**: Text content is displayed over the glassmorphic effect, making it easy to read while maintaining the aesthetic of the design.

## Tech Stack Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the claymorphism and glassmorphism effects, as well as making the design responsive.
- **Flexbox & Grid**: Used to create the layout and ensure that the design is responsive across different screen sizes.
